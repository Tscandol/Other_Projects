This was Hackaton hosted at 42shcool Paris and other locations around the world (Munich, Belgrade, San-Francisco, New-York...)     
It took place on the last week-end of october.  
    
Teams of 3 to 5 persons  
We were provided with a Bitalino Plugged Kit which we used as a hub were we connected all the measurement devices.   
As measurement devices we had :  
- 1 ECG (électrocardiogramme).
- 1 EEG (électroencéphalogramme).
- 1 EMG (électromyogramme).

Our idea was to use the metrics given by this devices to make a game that will repsond to specific triggers seet for particuliaar Biomarkers.  
(ie : A 2d platformer Game where gameSpeed is regulated by heartrate and may more). We were also planning if we had time to make a VR visualizer for all this Biomarkers with an artistic way of display.

In order to connect Bitalino Device We had to use Anaconda to make a specific environnement with python installed were we could start TimefluxPluggin.  
A pluggin allowing to recover and automatically apply filters to raw data making it easier to understand.

As we were not used to anaconda and Yaml (language use to configurate Timeflux) it took us a bit of time to be abble to display something first of all.
